This repository contains the ROSETTA ontology of robotics devices and skills.

rosetta.owl is a result of cooperative work done in the EU FP7 ROSETTA project and is based on earlier results (ontologies) from RoSta and SIARAS projects. Its goals and structure are documented in a number of papers, in particular in:
[1] Mathias Haage,  Jacek Malec, Anders Nilsson, Klas Nilsson and Slawomir Nowaczyk. Declarative-knowledge-based reconfiguration of automation systems using a blackboard architecture, Proc. 11th Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Eds: Anders Kofod-Petersen, Fredrik Heintz and Helge Langseth, IOS Press, pp. 163--172, doi: 10.3233/978-1-60750-754-3-163, 2011.

The ontology requires further work and polishing before reaching 1.0 status. The necessary fixes include:
1. taking care of parameters and properties in a systematic way;
2. taking away non-essential individuals, mostly inserted there during testing;
3. making up the mind regarding which unit ontology to link to;
4. better documentation, both included in the ontology and an external one.

Any comments and fixes are appreciated. jacek.malec@cs.lth.se
