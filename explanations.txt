QUDT ontology has been inconsistent, both in versions 1.0, originally
adopted in Rosetta work, and in 1.1, adopted in hope that problems
have been resolved.

Manner of verifying it: 

loading http://data.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/dimension.owl
into Protege 4.1.0 (build 239) with Hermit 1.3.8 as reasoner yields
inconsistency.
loading http://data.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/dimension.owl
into Protege 3.5 (version 14.0) withPellet 1.5.2 as reasoner yields
inconsistency.

loading http://data.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/quantity.owl
into Protege 4.1.0 (build 239) with Hermit 1.3.8 as reasoner yields
inconsistency.

loading http://data.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/qudt.owl
into Protege 4.1.0 (build 239) with Hermit 1.3.8 as reasoner yields
no errors: this ontology is consistent.

loading http://data.qudt.org/qudt/owl/1.0.0/unit.owl
into Protege 4.1.0 (build 239) with Hermit 1.3.8 as reasoner yields
inconsistency.

loading http://qudt.org/1.1/vocab/dimensionalunit
into Protege 4.1.0 (build 239) with Hermit 1.3.8 as reasoner yields
inconsistency.

Protege 4.3.0 (build 304) yields the same results as above on all five
files.

(It has been quoted here, as this behaviour might be a peculiarity of
a combination ontology editor + reasoner, rather than an actual
inconsitency in the logical sense. However, the explanations provided
by the reasoner, together with repeatability of the issue, suggests
that an actual inconsistency is present.)

It has been decided that fixing the issue (requires substantial
changes in several files, both vocabulaty ontologies, and 
schemas) would require publishing a new variant of the qudt. In order
to make it usable via import by other ontologies (e.g. rosetta.owl and
other related ones) and to adhere to the license (Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License), it would require a
complex effort with refactoring (in order to not mix URIs of the
original QUDT ontologies and the modified ones) and to make sure that
inclusion is clear with respect to what ontology is being used.

Therefore it has been deemed appropriate to find and try another quantity and
dimensions ontology in the context of Rosetta. The choice has been the
Ontology of units of Measure and related concepts (OM) (cite: Hajo
Rijgersberg, Mark van Assem and Jan Top, Ontology of Units of Measure
and Related Concepts, Semantic Web Journal, 4(1), pp. 3--13, 2012.)
available at http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/om-1.8/ 
The cited article explains in relative detail design differences
between OM and QUDT. It seems that they are of no importance for rosetta.owl.
